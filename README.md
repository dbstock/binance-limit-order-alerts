# Chrome Extension - Binance Order Filled Alert

Read the code before you install this. Every single line.
Plays an audio alert when an order is placed, cancelled, or filled.
This is a very bare-bones extension, lacking some of the things you'd expect from
an extension published on the Chrome Web Store, such as an icon or pop-up menus for configuration.
I may or may not add those things but if you want that, let me know.
